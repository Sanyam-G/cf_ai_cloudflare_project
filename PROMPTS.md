# AI Usage Disclosure

**Scope:** Documentation Generation (`README.md`)
**Model:** Large Language Model (LLM)

## Overview
This document outlines the specific use of generative AI in this project. The project documentation and this file were generated using AI to ensure clarity and standard formatting.

## Prompt Used
The following prompt was issued to the AI to generate the `README.md` file:

> "Create a README.md file for a project called 'Persistent Memory AI Assistant'.
>
> **Architecture:**
> - Backend: Cloudflare Worker acting as an API, handling CORS.
> - AI Model: Llama 3 via Cloudflare Workers AI.
> - Storage: Cloudflare KV for JSON chat history.
> - Frontend: Local HTML file served via Python, exposed via Cloudflare Tunnel.
>
> **Constraints:**
> - Do not use emojis.
> - Do not use dashes or em-dashes in the prose (bullets are fine).
> - Explain the hybrid local/cloud setup clearly.
> - Provide exact terminal commands for: creating the KV namespace, deploying the worker, editing the config, and running the local tunnel."

## Verification
The output generated by the AI was manually verified against the codebase to ensure:
1.  Terminal commands correspond to the actual file names and `wrangler` syntax.
2.  The architecture description accurately reflects the code in `worker.js`.
3.  Prerequisites matched the actual development environment.
